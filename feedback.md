Morse Code	

It sounds possible but may be of high difficulty. I am worried that you may have trouble getting the board to send messages to the websites through Wifi, so of your three ideas I would advise against this one. The difficulty is not in the code for the boards but with the python code used to interface the boards with the internet. You can still do it if you want but just be aware of difficulties you might run into with the wifi.	

Concurrent boards	

Again sounds possible but may be of high difficulty. I am worried that you may have trouble getting the board to send messages to the websites through Wifi, so I would advise against this one. The difficulty is not in the code for the boards but with the python code used to interface the boards with the internet.	

Connect to Kinect	

Sounds like a feasible idea. However, I don't know if this is complex enough as you're just reading in data and doing a simple operation on the board. Try to have the board be more involved than just streaming data.


Doom	

Sounds like a feasible idea. The problem is, since we are mostly grading for the code you write for your board, not for what you might have running on the computer, try to have the board be more involved than just streaming data.
